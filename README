To build, you need Z3 installed on your system. I used Z3 4.6.0.

To build, just run

    make

This builds the executable `./synthesis`. This binary takes a JSONified ivy source file on stdin.
Therefore it's easier to run with the wrapper script `run.sh`, e.g.,

    ./run.sh examples/leader-election.ivy
